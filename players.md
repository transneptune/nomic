        I'm looking to explore practical government, especially in the small scale. I want to see how or if git collaboration with non-code projects works. I want to do this while still playing a game, though I am uncertain as to what form that game should take. I want to explore structured communication between close friends.

        I'm intending to practice good git discipline, the use of git on non-code projects, play a game I've long known about and never played, think about government and how it relates to win conditions, and also explore long-scale sustainable systems and the utility of constant continuing legislation.
