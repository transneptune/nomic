    - ** Statement of Purpose **
    
        I'm looking to explore practical government, especially in the small scale. I want to see how or if git collaboration with non-code projects works. I want to do this while still playing a game, though I am uncertain as to what form that game should take. I want to explore structured communication between close friends.
